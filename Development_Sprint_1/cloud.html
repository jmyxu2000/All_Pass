   History of IBM Cloud  </div>
   <p> IBM begins its telling of the history of cloud computing not with AWS in the early 2000s, but with the invention of the mainframe back in the 1950s. It follows the thread of the story through IBM's 1970s development of the VM operating system, which enabled multiple virtual machines on a shared node.</p><br>

   <p> The company first dove into modern cloud computing in 2008, when it announced a software as a service collaboration suite codenamed Bluehouse. That suite became LotusLive, which launched in early 2009 and later was renamed IBM SmartCloud for Social Business.</p><br>

   <p>In 2009, IBM also launched Cloudburst, a tool for setting up a private cloud, and its first real IaaS service, the IBM Smart Business Storage Cloud, appeared that same year.</p><br>

   <p> The company continued adding cloud services to its portfolio, and in 2011 it announced a major new cloud effort under the SmartCloud brand name.</p><br>

   <p>IBM's cloud efforts took a major step forward in 2013, when it acquired SoftLayer, which was then the world's largest privately held cloud computing infrastructure provider. IBM continued running SoftLayer as a separate service, but also begin integrating SoftLayer technology into its cloud hardware, software, and services. At the same time, IBM also set up a Cloud Services division within the company.</p><br>

   <p> In early 2014, IBM said it would expand SoftLayer and launched a public beta of a PaaS service called Bluemix. A few months later, Bluemix hit general availability, and since then, it has taken on more and more importance in the overall IBM Cloud strategy. Today, Bluemix encompasses IaaS services and IBM's extensive Watson cognitive computing services, as well as its PaaS offerings.</p><br>

 <div class="subhead">  IBM Cloud Services </div>

 <p> Because IBM seems to be focusing more attention on Bluemix than SoftLayer, this list will cover its Bluemix offerings rather than those available through SoftLayer. The company divides its Bluemix Services into twelve categories:</p><br>
<p> Compute Infrastructure — includes its bare metal servers (single-tenant servers that are highly customizable), virtual servers, GPU computing, POWER servers (based on IBM's POWER architecture) and server software</p><br>
 <p> Compute Services — includes OpenWhisk serverless computing, containers and Cloud Foundry runtimes</p><br>
 <p> Storage — includes object, block and file storage, as well as server-backup capabilities</p><br>
 <p> Network — includes load balancing, Direct Link private secure connections, network appliances, content delivery network and domain services</p><br>
 <p> Mobile — includes IBM's Swift tools for creating iOS apps, its MobileFirst Starter package for getting a mobile app up and running, and its Mobile Foundation app back-end services</p><br>
 <p>Watson — includes IBM's artificial intelligence and machine learning services, which it calls "cognitive computing," such as Discovery search and content analytics, Conversation natural language services and speech-to-text </p><br>
 <p> Data and analytics — includes data services, analytics services, big data hosting, Cloudera hosting, MongoDB hosting and Riak hosting
Internet of Things — includes IBM's IoT platform and its IoT starter packages</p><br>
 <p> Security — includes tools for securing cloud environments, such as a firewall, hardware security modules (physical devices with key management capabilities), Intel Trusted Execution Technology, security software and SSL certificates</p><br>
 <p> DevOps — includes the Eclipse IDE, continuous delivery tools and availability monitoring</p><br>
 <p>Application services — includes Blockchain, Message hub and business rules, among others </p><br>
 <p> Integration — includes tools for building virtual bridges for hybrid cloud and multi-cloud environments, such as API Connect and Secure Gateway</p><br>
