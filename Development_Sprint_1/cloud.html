 <h3> History of IBM Cloud </h>
<p> IBM begins its telling of the history of cloud computing not with AWS in the early 2000s, but with the invention of the mainframe back in the 1950s. It follows the thread of the story through IBM's 1970s development of the VM operating system, which enabled multiple virtual machines on a shared node.</p>

 <p> The company first dove into modern cloud computing in 2008, when it announced a software as a service collaboration suite codenamed Bluehouse. That suite became LotusLive, which launched in early 2009 and later was renamed IBM SmartCloud for Social Business.</p>
 
 <p>In 2009, IBM also launched Cloudburst, a tool for setting up a private cloud, and its first real IaaS service, the IBM Smart Business Storage Cloud, appeared that same year.</p>
 
 <p> The company continued adding cloud services to its portfolio, and in 2011 it announced a major new cloud effort under the SmartCloud brand name.</p>
 
 <p>IBM's cloud efforts took a major step forward in 2013, when it acquired SoftLayer, which was then the world's largest privately held cloud computing infrastructure provider. IBM continued running SoftLayer as a separate service, but also begin integrating SoftLayer technology into its cloud hardware, software, and services. At the same time, IBM also set up a Cloud Services division within the company.</p>
 
 <p> In early 2014, IBM said it would expand SoftLayer and launched a public beta of a PaaS service called Bluemix. A few months later, Bluemix hit general availability, and since then, it has taken on more and more importance in the overall IBM Cloud strategy. Today, Bluemix encompasses IaaS services and IBM's extensive Watson cognitive computing services, as well as its PaaS offerings.</p>
